# SVHN-data
I'm going to perform different models on this data and find the best!
The work is still in progress.
1. The first model is a simple 5-layer CNN. There is no validation set in this version, only training and test sets exist.
This model get 91.6% training accuracy and 88.3% test accuracy. We seem to have some bias and some overfitting problem, though not very high. I will try to cure this in the next versions!
